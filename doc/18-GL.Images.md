# The package `GL.Images`

This package is only available if you include the project `opengl-images.gpr` as
a dependency to your project.
This project is provided by the Alire crate `openglada_images`.

`GL.Images` provides functions to load images to textures.
It uses the `GID` library to decode the image source, which can be a file path
or an Ada `Stream`.

`GL.Images` serves as a simple texture loading facility and as example for users
who want to have more control over image loading by using the GID library
directly.

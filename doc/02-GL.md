# The package `GL`

This is the root package of the core OpenGL wrapper.

The index types for vector and matrix types are defined here because they would
cause problems with cyclic dependencies when they were defined in `GL.Types`.

`Flush` and `Finish` act like their conterparts in the OpenGL API.

`Init` must be called once to load function pointers of post-OpenGL 1.1
functionality. For your convenience, `Glfw` calls `GL.Init` when new Windows are
created so that you do not need to call it directly when using the GLFW wrapper.

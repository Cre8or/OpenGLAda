# The package `GL.Types`

This package defines most of the basic types used in OpenGL. Note that the
single-precision floating point type is named `Single` to avoid collission with Ada's
`Float` type.

For each type, an instance of `GL.Algebra` is available. These instances provide
vector and matrix types for that base type. The usual mathematical operations on
vectors and matrices are also available. The vectors and matrices use the indexes
`X`, `Y`, `Z` and `W`. The `W` value is used in the homogeneous coordinate system.

The child package `GL.Types.Colors` provides the special `Color` type which consists
of four components which are indexed with `R`, `G`, `B` and `A`. A `Basic_Color`
without the alpha value is also available. Each color component is a single-precision
floating point value between `0.0` and `1.0`.

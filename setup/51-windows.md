# Windows Setup

**General advice:** Keep in mind that you need to spread the DLLs you link to
along with your binaries for them to work on other systems.

## GNAT Community 2018

 * Download and install GNAT Community Edition *x86 Windows (64bits)* from
   [AdaCore's Download Site][1]. This guide assumes you install it to
   `C:\GNAT\2018`.
   Make sure the `bin` folder is in the `PATH` of your shell.
 * Download *64-bit Windows binaries* from the [GLFW download section][2]
   (tested with GLFW 3.2.1).
   Open the zip folder and copy the file `glfw3.dll` from the `lib-mingw-w64`
   folder into `C:\GNAT\2018\lib`.
 * If you want to use FreeType, you need at least FreeType 2.7.1. There is an
   [semi-official GitHub repository][3] which hosts current Windows binaries
   known to work; get the `freetype.dll` file from the `win64` folder and copy
   it into `C:\GNAT\2018\lib`.
 * The FreeType library requires the Visual C++ Redistributable libraries for
   Visual Studio 2017. Download and install the `x64` version from [here][4] and
   install it.
 * Open your shell and navigate to the root folder of OpenGLAda. Execute:

        $ gprbuild -p -P opengl-test.gpr -XWindowing_System=windows

   This should produce executables in the `bin` folder inside OpenGLAda.
 * You can now either add `C:\GNAT\2018\lib` to your `PATH` or copy the
   DLLs from there to the `bin` folder. One of those two options is
   necessary so that the binaries can find the dll.

## TDM-GCC 64bit

These instructions are for building 64bit binaries with TDM-GCC on Windows.

 * Download and install the 64bit TDM-GCC compiler from [here][6]. In the
   installation wizard, make sure to check the (by default unchecked) *ada*
   option. Make sure the `bin` folder is in the `PATH` of your shell.

<!-- These currently do not work â€“ uncomment when fixed

 * Download `gpr-tools.zip` from [here][16] and extract its contents to the
   folder where you installed TDM-GCC (e.g. `C:\TDM-GCC-64\`).

-->

 * Download the *64-bit Windows binaries* from the [GLFW download section][2]
   (tested with GLFW 3.2.1).
 * Open the zip folder and copy the file `glfw3.dll` from the `lib-mingw-w64`
   folder into `C:\TDM-GCC-64\lib`.
 * If you want to use FreeType, you need at least FreeType 2.7.1. There is an
   [semi-official GitHub repository][3] which hosts current Windows binaries
   known to work; get the `freetype.dll` file from the `win64` folder and copy
   it into `C:\TDM-GCC-64\lib`.
 * The FreeType library requires the Visual C++ Redistributable libraries for
   Visual Studio 2017. Download and install the `x64` version from [here][4] and
   install it.
 * Open your shell and navigate to the root folder of OpenGLAda. Execute:

        $ gnatmake -p -P opengl-test.gpr -XWindowing_System=windows
        $ gnatmake -p -P opengl-text-test.gpr -XWindowing_System=quartz

   This should produce executables in the `bin` folder inside OpenGLAda.
 * You can now either add `C:\TDM-GCC-64\lib` to your `PATH` or copy the
   DLLs from there to the `bin` folder. One of those two options is
   necessary so that the binary can find the dll.
